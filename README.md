# aoc_rust_2022

Just like last year, I am doing Advent of Code again! And again in Rust but this time around I am allowing myself a few helper libraries like `itertools` or `scan_fmt!` to make my life somewhat easier.

I don't intend to write the most performant, elegant or clean Rust code ever -- I do intend try to write somewhat reasonable code though. Some solutions might not be the most *idiomatic* versions of themselves and will go somewhat against what Rust usually tries to enforce but that's just how it goes with coding puzzles!
